Use this website to create and store a list a vendors your business has relationships with, as well as orders that your vendors have ordered. This website will allow you to view vendors(name, description) and order details (title, description, cost, date/time of order) of those entered.

# Setup/Installation Requirements
	From the terminal
  Clone my respository from GitHub using git clone. https://github.com/88-1982/PierresTracker.Solutions.git in your terminal.
  Navigate to the downloaded folder using cd commmand.


# Testing
To run MS tests you will need to navigate to the PierresTracker.Tests folder (cd PierresTracker.Tests) in the command line and then run dotnet restore.
You should now see 'obj' folders in both the PierresTracker.Tests folder and PierresTracker folder.
At this point you should be able to successfully run dotnet test in the command line (keep in mind you should still be in the PierresTracker.Tests folder).
